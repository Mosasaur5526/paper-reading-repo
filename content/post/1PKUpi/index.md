title: "2020 PKU Pi Day Problem: Pi Approximation"
subtitle: 4 integers between 1 to 20, as well as 7 kinds of operations (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logarithm, factorial and exponentiation), are the only things allowed in approximating the irrational number, Pi. Each integer can merely appear once in the final equation you submit eventually, but appearing times of those calculating signs is unlimited.
