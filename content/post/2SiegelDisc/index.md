title: Siegel Disc Exploration With Matplotlib
subtitle: Recently I've been studying complex dynamics by myself. As its name suggests this is such a complicated branch of mathematics that requires solid foundation in complex analysis, measure theory, set theory and so on for people to understand what it is talking about. Maybe I exaggerate. Whatever, in this article I'll show some exploration results of a kind of topological construction of Fatou stable area, Siegel disc, named after its finder, with the help of Matplotlib (a famous side-package of Python specializes in visualization).
